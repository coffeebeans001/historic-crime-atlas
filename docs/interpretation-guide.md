Interpreting the Data

This application visualises historic criminal trial records from the Old Bailey Proceedings.

While the interface presents numerical trends and mapped locations, these outputs should not be interpreted as direct measurements of crime in society.

The data reflects recorded prosecutions, not total criminal activity.

What the Data Represents
Each entry corresponds to a trial recorded by a central criminal court in London.

Therefore, the dataset represents:

Cases that were reported
Cases that authorities chose to prosecute
Cases that reached court
Cases that were documented and preserved

It does not represent all crimes committed.

Many offences never reached court, particularly those involving marginalised individuals or communities with limited access to legal recourse.

Conviction Rates Are Not Crime Rates

A higher conviction rate does not mean crime increased.

It may indicate:
Changes in policing practices
Shifts in legal definitions
Availability of evidence
Jury expectations
Social attitudes toward certain groups
Court procedural reforms

Likewise, a lower conviction rate does not necessarily indicate improved social conditions.

Historical Bias and Record Imbalance

The historical record contains structural biases:
Women appear less frequently in earlier records
Certain offences were selectively prosecuted
Property crimes were prioritised over violent crimes at times
Poorer individuals were more likely to be prosecuted than wealthier offenders

Wider confidence intervals in early periods reflect limited surviving records rather than statistical error.

Geographic Interpretation

Map locations represent trial-associated places, not always exact crime scenes.

They may correspond to:
Parish jurisdiction
Arrest location
Residence of the accused
Administrative recording area

The map should therefore be interpreted as a spatial pattern of legal processing rather than a precise crime map.

Purpose of the Visualisation

The goal of this project is educational:
To help users explore how justice, enforcement, and record-keeping changed over time — not to measure morality, danger, or social decline.

The application is best understood as a historical lens rather than a predictive or comparative crime tool.
