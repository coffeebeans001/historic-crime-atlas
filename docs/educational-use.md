Educational Use Guide

Purpose

This project is designed as an exploratory public-history tool.

It is intended to help learners engage with historical criminal justice data through interaction, comparison, and interpretation rather than memorisation.

The visualisations support discussion about historical change, social context, and statistical uncertainty.

They should not be used as standalone evidence of social behaviour without supporting historical study.

Suitable Learning Contexts

This resource may be used in:

Secondary education (history and social studies)
Undergraduate teaching (history, criminology, sociology, data literacy)
Public learning environments (museums, heritage, community projects)
Independent research and self-directed learning

What Students Should Learn From It

1. Historical change over time

Users can observe how recorded crime patterns and outcomes shift across decades.

Key point:

The chart reflects recorded trials, not total crime in society.

2. Uncertainty in historical records

Confidence intervals represent limited sample sizes in earlier periods.

Students should understand:

Narrow bands do not mean certainty
Wide bands do not mean error
They indicate how much evidence survives

3. Recorded justice vs lived reality

Court records reflect:

enforcement priorities
legal definitions
institutional bias
reporting practices

They do not represent the full experience of the population.

4. Spatial interpretation

The map shows where trials were recorded relative to a location, not where crimes necessarily occurred.

This distinction is important:

Historical legal geography differs from modern policing geography.

Teaching Suggestions

Educators are encouraged to:

Compare different decades rather than single years
Ask why patterns change rather than whether they are “true”
Pair the tool with primary sources or reading material
Discuss bias in historical records
Introduce basic statistical reasoning using the confidence intervals

Responsible Use

This tool visualises real historical individuals recorded in legal documents.

Users should avoid:

treating defendants as fictional characters
drawing conclusions about modern populations
interpreting absence of data as absence of behaviour

Citation

When used in teaching or presentations, reference the project as an interpretive visualisation based on historical court records rather than as a primary dataset.

Future Expansion

This educational guide may later include:

classroom exercises
discussion prompts
downloadable worksheets
guided exploration tasks
